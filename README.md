<h1>Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine </h1>
This tutorial outlines a thorough series of steps on how to create and setup a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure and how to connect it with Remote Desktop connection.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)




<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Open Azure dashboard

In the dashboard section there are various tools and services, however before a virtual machine (VM) is established, a Resource group is prerequisite. It can be created by clicking on the icon (indicated by the shorter arrow), or type "resource group" in the search bar (indicated by the longer arrow).

- Step 2: Create Resource group

In this section, there are two options to choose from to start creating a resource group. Whether the option (indidated by the the shorter arrow, or the option indicated by the longer arrow is selected), they both lead to the same page on creating a resource group.


- Step 3: Name the resource group and select region to complete the set up

The section indicated by the shorter arrow is what the resource group should be named. It can be named anything, however it would be ideal that the name of the resource group aligns with the content (s) that will be stored into it to be more organised. For example: In the resource group on the image shown, it is named "AD-lab2023" because a lab with Active Directory configuration will be conducted and stored inside of the resource group so that the lab can be easily identifiable as to which resource group is belongs to. The region section (indicated by the longer arrow) is where the storage account is being created, that is whichever region of the world the resource group is being created, select accordingly. Afterwhich, click on "Review + create" (in the bottom left corner) to finish setting up the resource group.

Step 4: Validation status and creation of resource group
